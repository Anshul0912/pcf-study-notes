## Metrics

- What is "PCF Metrics"? What information does it provide?

> PCF built-in metrics information
> - Container metrics: CPU, memory, disk %
- HTTP metrics: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, request latency
- App events: create, update, start, stop, and crash

- Do you understand how to use the metrics to spot a badly performing application? For example: CPU or memory usage?
